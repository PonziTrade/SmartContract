// This is a Ponzi smart contract that was used in the www.ponzi.trade project. The main difference between this Ponzi project and others is that in this project the admin does not have any access to your funds. When you want to withdraw your profit, 20% of the amount will be paid to the admin wallet with the address [0x865f51332e458Ba52204496d9Bd609Df65067847]. And 10% will be paid to your referrer. As long as the project has new investors, you can withdraw your profits, and if not, you should wait for new investors to join.
